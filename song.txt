You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be? You're frozen
When your heart's not open

You're so consumed with how much you get
You waste your time with hate and regret. You're broken
When your heart's not open

Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly


Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up
I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call
<<<<<<< HEAD
Baby night and day
I'm fed up
I'm tired of waiting on you
